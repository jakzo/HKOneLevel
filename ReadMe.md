# OneLevel (BETA)

> üöß **IMPORTANT:** This mod is usable but not finished yet üöß

Hollow Knight mod that makes Hallownest one big level rather than a collection of separate rooms.

Features:

- All areas of Hallownest are loaded into the world at once (incomplete)
- Zoom in/out using by scrolling with the mouse wheel

## Known issues and caveats

This mod started out of curiosity after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24CbP6nP4Fc) and is still very incomplete.

- **Not all the chunks have been mapped yet**
  - Currently I've only mapped Dirtmouth and part of Forgotten Crossroads
- **Dying spawns the chunk in the wrong location**
  - Just haven't gotten around to handling this case yet
- **Weird movement bugs like sliding when transitioning into a chunk**
  - Don't know what's happening there, haven't looked at it yet
- **Some scenes overlap visually**
  - Some scenes have visual elements that extend outside their bounds and overlap neighboring scenes
  - These will need to be manually fixed on a case-by-case basis
- **Parallax effect looks weird at certain angles**
  - The levels weren't designed to be looked at from below, so you can see things like floating shrubs in Dirtmouth when looking from a lower camera angle than normal
  - Might be possible to mitigate somewhat by experimenting with making the perspective more orthogonal
- **Particle effects are removed**
  - Their position is tied to the camera so the effect doesn't work when zoomed out
  - Shouldn't be too hard to decouple their position
- **Background items are overly/underly blurred**
  - Compared to the unmodded game the blurring/visibility of background items is inconsistent depending on the zoom level
  - I tried fixing this a bit but will require more work
- **Camera limits and locks are removed**
  - Normally the camera will stay still in certain places like boss battles, important moments or the edge of the map
  - There are lower limits harcoded in the camera methods of the game (since every scene has `(0, 0)` at the bottom-left corner) so I just moved the entire map to the top-right and removed the scene upper bounds and camera lock game objects to save time trying to make it work nice when the player could be zoomed in any amount
- **You can see in dark areas**
  - Normally the you can only see about a screen's width around you even in lit areas of the game, but that defeats the purpose of this mod if you can't see any areas but the one you're in!
- **Some things don't reset when turning the mod off mid-game**
  - I'm lazy so small things like camera limits are not restored until the game changes them next

If you have found any issues not in this list, feel free to open a new issue in this repository on Github. If anyone is willing to contribute fixes for these issues that would be greatly appreciated. üôè

## Future plans

In addition to fixing the issues above I plan to implement these things in roughly this order:

- **Click and drag positioning of chunks** (to make arranging chunk positions easier during development)
- **Click and drag camera** to see parts of the map you are not already in
- **Options menu** for configuring the mod
- **Multiple chunk maps** so that custom maps and other areas can arrange their maps into a single level
- **Remove transition points** so the screen doesn't fade when moving between chunks and add colliders to allow walking between them

## Development

Update the `HollowKnightPath` variable in the `.csproj` to the path of your game then:

```ps
dotnet build
```
